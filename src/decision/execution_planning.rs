//! Execution planning utilities.
//!
//! After a highâ€‘level trading decision has been made, the order
//! quantity may need to be adjusted based on the available depth in
//! the order book. This module defines a simple planner that
//! reduces the execution size when liquidity is thin, thus helping
//! mitigate slippage.
