//! Decision stage trait.
//!
//! Stages encapsulate logic for producing a [`Decision`] from a
//! [`Signal`]. They are designed to be composed by the
//! [`SignalEngine`] and may run asynchronously (for example, when
//! querying external services). A stage can also decide whether it
//! is enabled for a given signal via the default implementation of
//! [`enabled`].

/// A unit of decision logic.
///
/// Each stage must have a unique identifier and implement
/// [`evaluate`], which returns a [`Decision`] for the provided
/// [`Signal`]. The default implementation of [`enabled`] always
/// returns `true`, but stages can override this to skip evaluation
/// based on contextual criteria (e.g. symbol filtering).
