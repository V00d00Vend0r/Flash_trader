//! Shared abstractions and helpers for decentralised exchanges (DEXes).
//!
//! To support multiple venues (such as Cetus and future integrations)
//! without tightly coupling the decision layer to any one exchange,
//! this module defines a set of traits and common data structures
//! representing liquidity pools, quotes and requests. The goal is to
//! enable a generic path through your trading strategy: given a
//! `QuoteRequest` you obtain a `QuoteResponse` regardless of the
//! underlying venue implementation.

/// sophisticated venues may honour additional fields such as slippage
